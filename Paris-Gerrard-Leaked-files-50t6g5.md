Paris Gerrard has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Paris Gerrard's breakthrough exhibition came in 2015, when she showcased her work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition, titled "Reflections," featured a series of large-scale paintings that explored the theme of self-reflection. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, with many art critics praising Paris Gerrard's unique artistic vision and her ability to connect with viewers on a deep emotional level.
